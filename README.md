# Recipe book with Django
A recipe book web app for my girlfriend. I love you <3

# Requirements
- Python 3.10 or Higher
- pipenv 2024.0.1 or Higher

```powershell
pip3 install pipenv
```
A virtual environment is created using the following command, and the subshell is opened:
```powershell
pipenv install django
pipenv shell
```
Creating a virtual environment is useful to keep the project isolated.

Now, clone the project:
```powershell
git clone https://github.com/simoare732/recibook.git
```

You can install all the required libraries using the command:
```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
